**Additional Recommendations:**
1. The Material Design dependency I added (`com.google.android.material:material:1.10.0`) is the most common Google dependency for Android apps
2. I also added ConstraintLayout as it's commonly used with view binding
3. The settings.gradle file was missing, which is essential for proper project configuration
4. All dependency versions are stable and compatible with your target SDK 34
5. If you need other Google dependencies (like Firebase, Play Services, etc.), you'll need to add them specifically based on your app's requirements

This fix should resolve the build error by completing the truncated dependency and ensuring all necessary project configuration files are present.
